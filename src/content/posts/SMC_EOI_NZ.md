###Skilled Migrant Category

New Zealand offers many opportunities for skilled migrants, particularly in industries and regions experiencing growth and skill shortages. The Skilled Migrant Category is for potential migrants who are interested in gaining New Zealand residence and have readily transferable skills and experience.

###Expression of Interest (EOI)

Applying under the Skilled Migrant Category is a two-stage process: you submit an EOI into the EOI Pool and wait to see if it is selected. If you are invited to apply for residence, you then have a four month period to lodge a residence application.

###Prerequisites

To be considered under this category you need to be of good health, good character, meet English language requirements and be under 56 years of age. To have an EOI accepted, you will also need to be claiming at least 160 points for what are called ‘employability and capacity building factors’—factors such as skilled employment, recognised qualifications and skilled work experience.

###The points system

The points system is designed to prioritise potential migrants who have the most to offer New Zealand so that Immigration New Zealand (INZ) can decide who to invite to apply for residence. Points are available for skilled employment in New Zealand, skilled work experience, qualifications and age. A variety of bonus points are also available for factors such as employment in areas of skill shortage and partner’s qualifications.
